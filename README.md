# mridulccsh

Welcome to **mridulccsh**, a simple shell implemented in Go. This shell provides basic command functionalities similar to those found in traditional command-line interfaces like PowerShell or CMD.

## Features

- **Built-in Commands**:
  - `ls`: List files in the current directory.
  - `cd <directory>`: Change the current working directory.
  - `mkdir <directory>`: Create a new directory.
  - `cp <source> <destination>`: Copy a file from the source to the destination.
  - `rm <file>`: Remove a specified file.
  - `cat <file>`: Concatenate and display the contents of a file.
  - `grep <pattern> <file>`: Search for a pattern in a file and display matching lines.
  - `version`: Show the version of mridulccsh.
  - `man`: Display a manual for available commands.

- **External Command Execution**: Execute any external command not handled by the shell.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.17 or later installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of command-line interface operations.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd mridulccsh
   ```

2. **Build the Executable**:
   Open a terminal in the directory where `main.go` is located and run:
   ```bash
   go build -o mridulccsh.exe main.go
   ```

3. **Run the Executable**:
   Navigate to the directory containing `mridulccsh.exe` and run:
   ```bash
   .\mridulccsh.exe
   ```

   If you want to run it from any directory, move `mridulccsh.exe` to a directory in your `PATH`, such as `C:\Program Files`.

## Usage

Once you run the shell, you will see a prompt (`>`). You can enter commands at this prompt.

  - To list files: 
    ```bash
    > ls
    ```
